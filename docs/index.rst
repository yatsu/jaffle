Turret |version|
================

.. note::

   Turret is in a pre-alpha stage.
   The configurations and the API may change without notice during this period.

   Turret is intended to be a development tool and does not care much about security. Arbitrary Python code can be executed in ``turret.hcl`` and you should not use it as a part of production environment. ``turret.hcl`` is like a Makefile or a shell script included in a source code repository.
